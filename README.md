# SEO Checker

SEO Checker is a simple web application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that allows you to analyze the SEO attributes of a web page. It fetches the content of a given URL and provides insights into its metadata, headings, images without alt attributes, keyword frequencies, and bigrams (i.e., two-word phrases).


## Features

- Check if the title and description meta tags are present.
- Identify headings (h1 to h6) and check for the presence of an h1 tag.
- List images without alt attributes.
- Display the most common keywords and bigrams found in the page content.
